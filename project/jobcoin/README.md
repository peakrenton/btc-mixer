## Todo: 
1. Abstract away the HTTP requests initially
2. Add unit tests for jobcoin.py main functions
3. Create JobCoin network that listens in on transactions
4. Futures block for async execution of discrete transactions
5. Add exceptions for Insufficient balance, malformed JSON
6. Get list of global transactions
7. Add doc strings to functions
8. Fix is_minted logic -- right now it's sender == None
9. Add 'info' logging
10. Every class into its own file
